# Machine Learning Components & Comparisons

This repository contains various Machine Learning projects and comparisons, implemented primarily in Python using Jupyter Notebooks.

## Projects

### 1. Classification Comparison (Iris Dataset)
**Location**: `CLassificationComparison/classificationcomparison.ipynb`

A comprehensive comparison of multiple classification algorithms using the standard Iris dataset.

**Implemented Algorithms:**
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)

**Features:**
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Pairplots and Correlation Matrices.
- Separate Confusion Matrix visualizations for each model.
- 2D Decision Boundary plots to visualize classification regions.
- Comparative analysis using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

**How to Run:**
1. Navigate to the `CLassificationComparison` directory.
2. Open `classificationcomparison.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Run all cells to execute training and visualization.
